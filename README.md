# finalGame
This was made for the AP Comp Sci game competition in 2017.  

It started out being a project for 6 people until over time each one dropped off until only I was left.  Once it was only me working on it I stopped commiting to github and changed the project structure dramatically.  You can see what we had before I worked on it on my own in either of the javaFiles folders (idk why there are two) and you can see the end product code that I wrote in TheEndProduct folder.  

The end project is downloadable in jar form [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dls802nbwllg4uy/AADXf7Sj2JIaxadVcjuHgbbNa?dl=1).  You have to unzip it then run it (ignore any warnings about being from an unidentified developer, I promise it isn't a virus)

I wrote all the collision detection, physics, block interaction and enemy ai myself.  The only libraries that were used were java's default included awt graphics library.
