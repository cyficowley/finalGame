TODO:


We need a legit story/what are we going to do with the game, so that we can decide what to do next


For each idea write if the following are needed::
INVENTORY
BREAKING BLOCKS
CUSTOM MAPS
WORLD GENERATION
ENEMIES

Write story ideas below:


Straight up terraria, you mine you fight bosses:
NEEDS:: ALL
STORY:: no idea I haven't actually thought about it these are all examples

Just exploring rpg
NEEDS:: INVNETORY, CUSTOM MAPS, ENEMIES
STORY:: whatever someone feels like writing we can have multiple types of these

parqour thingy
NEEDS:: CUSTOM MAPS, CREATIVE JUMPING ELEMENTS
STORY:: none

vertical dungeon crawler
NEEDS:: CUSTOM MAPS OR GENERATED MAPS, INVENTORY, ENEMIES
STORY:: could be none, we'd need like main bosses and stuff but not a main story

Wave based enemy game
NEEDS:: COuld do all?
STORY:: idk but like you have to survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies coming from different places. You could have a minecraft element in that you can prepare for the waves  by digging out caves and crap, maybe lay traps from the inventory, you could upgrade your characters speed, jump, damage, health etc idk  I like this idea - CYrus
