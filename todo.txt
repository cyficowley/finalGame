TODO:
How to save and load things
write an inventory
come up with things to deal with items
crafting
how to break blocks good

We need a legit story/what are we going to do with the game, so that we can decide what to do next


For each idea write if the following are needed::
INVENTORY
BREAKING BLOCKS
CUSTOM MAPS
WORLD GENERATION
ENEMIES

Write story ideas below:

Straight up terraria, you mine you fight bosses:
NEEDS:: ALL
STORY:: no idea I haven't actually thought about it these are all examples
this si terrible we are not making this stupid game - shane

Just exploring rpg
NEEDS:: INVNETORY, CUSTOM MAPS, ENEMIES
STORY:: whatever someone feels like writing we can have multiple types of these

parqour thingy
NEEDS:: CUSTOM MAPS, CREATIVE JUMPING ELEMENTS
STORY:: none
this could work kind of like the background moves constantly left and you have to stay on the screen and the map gets harder nd stuff like a speedrunner style map with different paths and stuff, multiplayer option

vertical dungeon crawler
NEEDS:: CUSTOM MAPS OR GENERATED MAPS, INVENTORY, ENEMIES
STORY:: could be none, we'd need like main bosses and stuff but not a main story

Wave based enemy game
NEEDS:: COuld do all?
STORY:: idk but like you have to survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies coming from different places. 
You could have a minecraft element in that you can prepare for the waves  by digging out caves and crap, 
maybe lay traps from the inventory, you could upgrade your characters speed, jump, damage, health etc
I like this idea -Cyrus




GAME prototype idea:
Player starts on randomly generated world, factions that fight eachother
-collects items/resources/elements to build a space thingy / spaceship
End goal of each planet = build a space port
We need to make crafting and invetory and all the items
