Game Ideas

In  order to create ideas for a game, we have to set basic parameters for what the world/environment and mechanics will be like.
For the benifit of simplicity:
-the game will have components of an endless side scroller 
-the game will be 2D(obviously), but could possible have game mechanics or a map in a top down 2d 
 prespective rather than a full 2d side prespective
-will obey 2d physics and mechanical laws
