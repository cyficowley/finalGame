Game Ideas

In  order to create ideas for a game, we have to set basic parameters for what the world/environment and mechanics will be like.
For the benifit of simplicity:
-the game will have components of an endless side scroller
-the game will be 2D(obviously), but could possible have game mechanics or a map in a top down 2d
 prespective rather than a full 2d side prespective
-will obey 2d physics and mechanical laws
//more ideas for basic commandments/laws are welcome

In the intrest of having a lot of expandability into different functions and a seemingly distant end-game scenareo(for replayability)
we could allow for the character to advance enough in the game to leave their starting world, and travel to other planets.
-by allowing travel to different planets, we open up the door to a lot of programmable gameplay:
	-adding mechanics for travel to new planets would be an intresting challenge to code, and add
	 reason for a player to "conquor" or advance through our challenges and objectives we set
	-this mechanic would add variation to the playable world
		-we could randomly generate planets with different graity, asthetics, o2 levels, etc

ESSENTIALLY:
We are creating a universe of generated planets
  -the player will start on one of these planets
    -in order to not kill the fps, only the planet they are on will be generated at the start
  -this planet will be like a mix of terraria but instead of blocks of minerals, we will
   use elements in the ground/environment that can be mined and refined
    -these elements can come in stores or caches(kind of like blocks), could hold a random range
     of the mass of the element
      -essentially, this system would incorperate more science
  -oceans will be explorable via submarines and boats
  -caverns, chasms, and dungeons
  -npcs throughout the world
    -some will join you, some wont
      -this will be based on a random value assigned to each npc


Can we destroy blocks
  -yes
Is this a mining game or an exploration and conquering dungeons game
  -yes
are we finding items to create stuff? like are we gonna be straight up teraria basically?
  -yes
  -kind of
