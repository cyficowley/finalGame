Game Ideas

In  order to create ideas for a game, we have to set basic parameters for what the world/environment and mechanics will be like.
For the benifit of simplicity:
-the game will have components of an endless side scroller
-the game will be 2D(obviously), but could possible have game mechanics or a map in a top down 2d
 prespective rather than a full 2d side prespective
-will obey 2d physics and mechanical laws
//more ideas for basic commandments/laws are welcome

In the intrest of having a lot of expandability into different functions and a seemingly distant end-game scenareo(for replayability)
we could allow for the character to advance enough in the game to leave their starting world, and travel to other planets.
-by allowing travel to different planets, we open up the door to a lot of programmable gameplay:
	-adding mechanics for travel to new planets would be an intresting challenge to code, and add
	 reason for a player to "conquor" or advance through our challenges and objectives we set
	-this mechanic would add variation to the playable world
		-we could randomly generate planets with different graity, asthetics, o2 levels, etc


Can we destroy blocks
  -yes
Is this a mining game or an exploration and conquering dungeons game
  -yes
are we finding items to create stuff? like are we gonna be straight up terraria basically?
  -yes
  -kind of
